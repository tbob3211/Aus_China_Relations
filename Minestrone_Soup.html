            <p> 
                As the predecessor of pizza, Flatbreads with toppings were consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks. However, the modern birthplace of pizza is southwestern Italy's Campania region, home to the city of Naples.
                It was originally thought of as cheap food that could be eaten quickly, until 1889 Queen Margherita visited Naples, Pizza became Queen's favorite food.
                Further then, thanks to immigration and the second world war, pizza spread more widely.

            <h3> Method </h3>
            <p>
                1. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan and add the onion, garlic, celery heart, carrot, cabbage and bay leaves. Lightly fry the vegetables for 2–3 minutes without letting them colour. Stir in the beans, potato and tomato, then cover the ingredients with water. Once the soup comes to the boil, add the rice and turn down to a simmer. Add a few good pinches of salt and simmer for 20–25 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Add the spinach, parsley and parmesan rind and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and taste for seasoning, adding extra salt if needed, and pepper. Serve with plenty of grated parmesan and crusty bread.
