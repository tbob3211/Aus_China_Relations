            <p> 
                As the predecessor of pizza, Flatbreads with toppings were consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks. However, the modern birthplace of pizza is southwestern Italy's Campania region, home to the city of Naples.
                It was originally thought of as cheap food that could be eaten quickly, until 1889 Queen Margherita visited Naples, Pizza became Queen's favorite food.
                Further then, thanks to immigration and the second world war, pizza spread more widely.

            <h3> Method </h3>
            <p>
                1. Mix the yeast and warm water in a bowl and stand for a few minutes or until foamy.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Place the flour in a large bowl, pour in the yeast mixture and mix until a dough comes together. Add the salt and knead lightly to incorporate. Knead vigorously on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes or until smooth, shiny and elastic. (If you have a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, by all means use it instead of your muscle power!). Dust with a little semola, then cover with a damp tea towel and rest for 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Using floured hands, stretch the dough into a rectangle, then fold the top and bottom thirds into the centre like folding a letter and then onto itself into a ball. Place in an oiled container fitted with a lid – make sure the container is large enough to allow plenty of room for rising. Cover and rest at room temperature for 6-8 hours. Give the dough a quick knead and shape back into a ball, then place the container in the refrigerator and stand overnight (or for up to 4 days), to slow-prove and develop flavour and texture.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. A couple of hours before you want to use the dough, remove from the refrigerator and take off the lid. Cover loosely with a tea towel and leave at room temperature for 2 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Preheat the grill function in your oven to as hot as it will go. Place a large cast-iron frying pan on the stove over high heat and allow to become super-hot.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Meanwhile, cut the dough into 2 (depending on how big you like your pizzas). Sprinkle one portion with semola and use your hands to stretch the dough into a disc, about 7-mm thick. In one fast movement, place the disc into the pan, spread a little tomato over the top, drizzle with oil and scatter with a few anchovies and capers. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the bottom is golden and slightly scorched and the top is puffed but still pale. Add a few bocconcini, then place the pan into the oven, straight under the grill and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the top is golden and burnished. Using oven mitts, remove the pan from the oven, slide the pizza onto a board, top with basil and a little extra virgin olive oil and enjoy hot! Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.
